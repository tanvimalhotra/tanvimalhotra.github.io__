Hello!

I'm a software developer from Ontario, Canada. I've recently completed my Bachelor of Applied Science in [Computer Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/ "Computer Engineering at uWaterloo") at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/ "University of Waterloo Homepage").

Throughout my education I've had experience working with both software and hardware, and really love learning new frameworks and technologies. I've developed software for a variety of different platforms ranging from embedded systems to mobile phones, however I always find myself being drawn back to the ever-evolving web. I really enjoy working with front-end technologies and like the design aspect involved with developing web pages, but I'll also dig into server-side logic and databases too.

I built this website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and it's currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"). It doubles as my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume "Mark Berger's Resume") and a place to post guides, code fragments, thoughts and anything else that's interesting.

Please feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">email</a> me if you have any questions or comments.
